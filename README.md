Categorical Data Analysis: Topic: What Attributes Presented in our Dataset Would Help Predict the Event of No Relapse of Cervical Cancer?


Cancer as we know it is a disease caused when cells divide uncontrollably and spread into
surrounding tissues. Now when it starts in the Cervix, it is known as cervical cancer. The cervix
connects the vagina to the upper part of the uterus. This is the portion of the women where a baby
grows when she is pregnant. It is a known fact that all women are at risk and it occurs most often
in women over the age of 30. ("Basic information about cervical cancer," 2021) It is the second
most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Most of the cases occur in less developed
countries where no effective screening systems are available. In high income countries, cervical
cancer incidents have more than halved over the past 30 years since the introduction of formal
screening programmes. Women in their early stages of tumor can be cured, although long term
morbidity from treatment is common. (Waggoner, 2003) If complications do occur then radical
hysterectomy or chemoradiation, or a combination of both are used to treat these complications
from the early stages. ("Cervical cancer," 2019) However, even with these options available, the
study on how to reduce the continuing effects of cervical cancer beyond the first stage is still far
from being solved. Furthermore, treatment of recurrent cervical cancer seems to remain
ineffective. Quality of life should be taken into account in treatment of women with primary and
recurrent cervical cancer. (Waggoner, 2003)
